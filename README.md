## Project-1 
## `Solved`
Design a project where as an input student will give a static number (between 1 to 6) and then roll the dice which randomly generate some value between 1 to 6. The winning situation arrives when the given static/fixed number exactly same to the number came after rolling the dice.<br>
<br>
User can play the game as many numbers of times he wants until user wants to exit, and whenever winning situation occur some scores must be given to the user, and these scores goes on adding if user play this game multiple number of times.
Note: Dice contains face value’s (1 to 6)<br>

## Project-2
## `Solved`
Create the Rock, Paper and Scissors game with Python, we need to take the user’s choice and then we need to compare it with the computer choice which is taken using the random module in Python from a list of choices, and if the user wins, then the score will increase by 1.
<br><br>
Example:<br>
User: Rock, Paper or Scissors?<br>
CPU: rock<br>
Tie<br>
User: Rock, Paper or Scissors?<br>
CPU: paper<br>
You win! Paper covers Rock<br>
User: Rock, Paper or Scissors?<br>
CPU: scissors<br>
You lose… Rock smashes Scissors<br>
Rock, Paper or Scissors?<br>
End the game<br>
Final Scores:<br>
CPU:1<br>
User:1<br>

## Project-3

## `Solved`

Email Slicer is just a simple tool that will take multiple email address as an input and slice it to produce the username and the domain associated with it. The email must be divided into two strings by using ‘@’ as the separator.<br><br>
So, user provides n number of email addresses and you have to design a logic to slice the username and the domain out of those email addresses. The domain part must print in capitals.
Note: Email addresses must be stored first in some container and then operate the required logic on it.<br><br>
Example:<br>
abc@gmail.com<br>
xyz@yahoo.com<br>
after slicing<br>
username :abc and domain: GMAIL.COM<br>
username: xyz and domain: YAHOO.COM<br>

## Project 4

## ``Solved``

Create a program that takes the length of the password as input and generates a random password of the same length. The strength of the password depends equally on the 4 properties mentioned below. If the password generated randomly following the rules or constraints given below, then that password is treated as good in terms of strength and accepted otherwise ignore that password.<br><br>
The properties to be followed for a strong password are:
- At least 12 characters.<br>
- A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters.<br>
- A mixture of letters and numbers. <br>
- Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., @ #?]
<br>

Note: do not use < or > in your password, as both can cause problems in Web browsers.

## Project-5

## `Solved`

The task is to create a script that generates a random number between a fixed range, and  if the user guesses the number right in three chances, then user wins otherwise user lose.
This game user can play as many numbers of times and whenever user wins a score is to be given to the user.<br><br>
At the end the users score must be displayed on the screen.
Hint: Make use of random module to design the game<br><br>
Abstract steps:
- The user enters the lower and upper bounds of the range.
As a result, the compiler generates a random integer between the range and stores it in a variable for future use.
- A while loop will be created for repetitive guessing.
- When a user guesses a number that is greater than a randomly selected number, the user receives the message “have one more try”. Your guess was too high.
- If the user guesses a number smaller than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output of “have one more try “. Your guess was too small”
- In addition, if the user guesses within a minimum number of attempts, they get a “Congrat’s” message and also get the winning scores.
- If the user fails to guess the integer in the minimum number of guesses, he/she will receive a “Better Luck Next Time!

## Project-7

## `Solved`

The task is to generate a random story every time user runs the program.<br><br>
Every time the user runs the program, we must produce a random tale. We'll first store the portions of the tales in distinct lists, and then use the Random module to choose random sections of the stories from those lists:<br><br>
To construct a random narrative, we first imported the random module, then built sections of the stories in separate lists, then randomly picked portions of the lists.<br><br>
Note: You store the portion of your tale/story in different lists, and during displaying the story when you pick the portions randomly your complete story must make some sense.
(Student is free to decide the input and output layout for this mini project)<br><br>
Hint: <br>
- Random module can be used to select random parts of the story stored in different lists.
- Sections of the story can be an adjective, a preposition, a proper noun, etc.

In this project you have to enter a range [A, B] and system will randomly pick any number from your given range and check the status of that given number.
The properties to be checked are:
Is that number is odd or even
Is that number is positive or negative number
Is that number is prime number or composite number.
After checking the status, you have to display all the properties followed by the randomly picked number.
For example 
Range is (1,12) and randomly picked number is 10
Then the properties followed by this number are:
10 is a positive number
10 is an even number
10 is a composite number

## `Solved`

Editorial/Explanation about Roman numbers:
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.<br><br>
<br>Symbol&emsp;Value<br>
I&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1<br>
V&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;5<br>
X&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;10<br>
L&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;50<br>
C &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;100<br>
D&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;500<br>
M&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1000<br><br>
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five, we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:<br>
- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9<br>
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.<br> 
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.<br>

Your task is create a converter which converts given roman numeral to an integer.<br>
